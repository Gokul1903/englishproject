                    <p class="fs-5 pt-4">Stephen William Hawking, CH, CBE, FRS, FRSA a British theoretical physicist, is the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Renowned for his contributions to the fields of cosmology and quantum gravity, with particular reference to his work on black holes, he has published enormous research work in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general. His popular science bestseller, A Brief History of Time, remained on the British Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. His scientific career of over 40 years, his books and public appearances have all credited with being an academic celebrity. Several awards like the coveted Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts were bestowed upon him for his incredible work. Hawking suffered a very rare condition called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known in the United States as Lou Gehrig's Disease. The illness has progressed over the years which left him almost completely paralysed until his death in 2018.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 pt-4">ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to the loss of voluntary muscle control. Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with ALS at the age of 21, and doctors initially gave him a bleak prognosis. Despite the grim outlook, he defied expectations by not only surviving but continuing his scientific pursuits while dealing with the challenges posed by the disease.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 pt-4">Stephen Hawking, the iconic theoretical physicist, faced the daunting challenge of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Diagnosed at the age of 21, Hawking defied grim predictions and continued to make groundbreaking contributions to cosmology while dealing with the progressive loss of muscle control.<br> <br>Despite the physical limitations imposed by ALS, Hawking's scientific legacy endured. His work on black holes, time, and the origins of the universe showcased his intellectual brilliance. Utilizing a speech-generating device, he communicated his ideas, proving the resilience of the human spirit.<br> <br>While this summary does not capture a personal connection, it reflects on the inspirational aspect of Hawking's journey. His life serves as a testament to the strength of the human mind and the potential for greatness even in the face of significant adversity.</p>
